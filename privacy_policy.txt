2. What data we collect

When you use Asset Tracker we may collect the following information:

1. Account data

Email address (used to create and log in to your Asset Tracker account)

Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication. We do not see or store your raw password.

2. In-app data you provide

Asset names, categories and amounts

Optional notes you create inside the app

These data are stored in backup so that you can restore them later.

3. Automatic data from third-party services (Ads)

Asset Tracker uses Google AdMob to show ads.

AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address and other usage data to show and measure ads.

For more details, please see Google’s own privacy policy.

We do not sell your data to anyone.

3. How we use your data

We use your data only for:

Creating and securing your Asset Tracker account

Saving your assets and notes

Backing up your data to the server so you can restore it later

Showing ads (via Google AdMob) to keep the app free

We do not use your data for any unrelated purposes.

---

4. Data storage, backup and restore

Asset data and notes are stored on a VPS server managed by S One Connection.

Backups are linked to your email address, so you can restore them even after reinstalling the app.

Communication between the app and the server is protected by standard web security (we recommend that you always keep your device updated and use secure networks).

If you change your device or reinstall the app, you can sign in with the same email address and use the Restore data option in the app menu to bring back your latest backup.

5. Data retention

Your data remain on our server as long as your Asset Tracker account exists.

If you stop using the app but do not delete your account, backups may stay on the server.

When you request deletion of your account (see section 7), we delete your account and backups within 30 days, except where we are legally required to keep data longer.
